## Binomial Beta Model

Suppose a study is being carried out where we want to study the number of cases of high 
blood pressure in an area of study. We define the ith person to be 1 if they exhibit high 
blood pressure and 0 otherwise. Its clear that we can model this process using the binomial 
distribution.

$$ y | \pi \sim Binom(\pi, n) $$
whose pdf is given by 

$$ y | \pi = {n\choose y}\pi^{y}(1-\pi)^{n-y} \propto \pi^{y}(1-\pi)^{n-y}$$
here $\pi$ is the probability of success. In order to completet the Bayesian Model we need to 
specify a prior distrubtion for $\pi$. A candidate distribution needs to allow for the $\pi$ to 
range from 0 to 1, we use the beta distrubtion for this.
